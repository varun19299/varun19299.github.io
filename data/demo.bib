abstract = {Single-photon sensors are a novel class of imaging sensors that are sensitive to the individual arrival of photons. In recent years, single-photon sensors have witnessed rapid growth in key sensor characteristics such as array resolution, which, for the first time, has made computer vision and imaging with these emerging sensors possible. This rapid growth has also spurred the development of algorithms that can harness the rich spatio-temporal scene information captured by single-photon sensors, which has led to several new imaging capabilities. These capabilities include imaging in challenging SNR conditions, high-dynamic range imaging, compensating extreme camera motion extents, and even providing the functionality of numerous imaging systems via post-capture processing. Our demo will showcase these exciting capabilities to a wide computer vision and graphics audience, and in doing so, make a case for the mainstream adoption of single-photon technology.},
