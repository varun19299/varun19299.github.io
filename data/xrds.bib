abstract = {Light impinges on a camera's sensor as a collection of discrete quantized elements, or photons. An emerging class of devices, called single-photon sensors, offers the unique capability of detecting individual photons with high-timing precision. With the increasing accessibility of high-resolution single-photon sensors, we can now explore what computer vision would look like if we could operate on light, one photon at a time.},
